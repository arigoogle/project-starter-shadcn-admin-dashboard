A responsive and accessible Admin Dashboard UI built with Shadcn and Vite.

I've been working on dashboard UIs both professionally and for personal projects. My goal has always been to create a reusable set of dashboard components for future useâ€”this project is the result of that effort. While I've developed several custom components, some parts are adapted directly from ShadcnUI examples.

- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Fully responsive design
- Accessibility-focused components
